Write some RDF as Turtle.

Yup, that is it. For now, at least.

I know what you are thinking. Why yet another RDF library? Surely writing some RDF as Turtle is pretty simple and 
straight-forward, so we are just reinventing the wheel here, right?

One would assume it is easy. But I looked at a bunch of RDF libraries and the way they model RDF makes absolutely no 
sense to me.

I know we all want to be as generic as possible, but as far as I am concerned, subjects are entities. Yes, I know, it 
has been proposed to allow literals to be used as subjects. Twenty years ago. It hasn't been adopted for more than
twenty years, so I am going to gamble here that it never will be, and I think it is a silly idea anyway.

Regarding the name, 'penyu' is the Indonesian/Malay word for 'turtle'. Wy Indonesian? Because it is a really cute 
language. Check it out. Also, it is nicely short and easy, and in most other languages I know, the word for 'turtle' 
is longer and harder to pronounce for English speakers.
